# Guessing-Number-Game
Simple Python Project

Just a game that has three levels of difficulty. Easy,mMedium, and hard. Easy has you choose from 0-10, medium 0-100, and hard 0-1000.

Hard tells you if your guess is too high or low. The other modes do not. 

Game is plays in a terminal. Might come back and add a UI once I learn how to do that with python
